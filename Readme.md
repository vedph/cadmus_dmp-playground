# Diff-Match-Patch Playground

This is a dummy, throwaway app used in-house to inspect the outcome of [Google's diff-match-patch library](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) and its possible usage for building a list of post-edit operations useful to understand what could be broken in layers once the base text has changed. Just dropping it in the repository as a didactic commodity to the developers team.
